## Mandatory External Research Phase (CRITICAL - Execute First)

**BEFORE analyzing canonical sources**, execute comprehensive external research using available tools:

### **Required Compliance Standards Research**

Execute web searches and document findings for:

#### **Multi-Jurisdictional Privacy Framework**

***

## Critical Anti-Contamination Framework (v2.3.0 Enhanced)

### **Mandatory File Versioning (Anti-Contamination)**

**STRICT CURRENT TIMESTAMP REQUIREMENT**:

- **Current MSK timestamp ONLY**: Use current execution time for ALL file creation
- **Format**: `docs/reports/{category}/2025-11/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-MSK-{type}.md` where YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM is CURRENT execution time
- **NEVER reuse existing timestamps**: Each execution gets unique timestamp regardless of previous files
- **NEVER modify existing files**: Always create completely new files with current timestamp

**Pre-Execution Quarantine Protocol (Mandatory)**:

**Step 1: Previous File Identification**

- Identify ALL existing files in docs/reports/ directories
- Create quarantine manifest listing ALL previous report files
- Mark ALL previous files as **CONTAMINATED-PREVIOUS-ANALYSIS**
- Log previous file timestamps and sizes for verification

**Step 2: Content Independence Verification**

- **ZERO reference to previous analysis**: No structural copying, conclusion inheritance, or content building
- **Fresh external research**: Complete new regulatory research cycle independent of previous findings
- **Independent persona analysis**: Each persona starts fresh without knowledge of previous conclusions
- **New scenario evaluation**: Build comparison from scratch using only canonical + current external sources

**Step 3: Clean Start Certification**

- Agent must explicitly declare: "No previous analysis files referenced or consulted"
- Verify all citations trace to canonical repository files or current external research
- Confirm all conclusions derived independently from fresh analysis
- Document independence audit trail

### **Enhanced Example-Copying Prevention (v2.3.0 Critical)**

**ANTI-TEMPLATE CONTAMINATION**:

- **NO direct copying from prompt examples**: All tables, diagrams, and content structures must be generated fresh
- **Example templates are GUIDANCE ONLY**: Format and structure hints, not content to copy
- **Create original content**: Research-derived data populating fresh structures
- **Verify content originality**: No placeholder text, example data, or template language in outputs

**Original Content Generation Requirements**:

- **Tables**: Populate with actual research findings, not example data
- **Mermaid diagrams**: Create based on actual scenario analysis, not prompt templates
- **Risk assessments**: Generate from actual regulatory research and canonical analysis
- **Persona insights**: Derive from independent persona analysis, not example outputs

**Template Contamination Detection**:

- **Flag copied examples**: If output matches prompt examples >50%, mark as TEMPLATE-CONTAMINATED
- **Verify research derivation**: All content must trace to external research or canonical sources
- **Check placeholder removal**: No "[X]", "Example", or template language in final outputs
- **Validate data authenticity**: All metrics, assessments, and conclusions must be research-based

### **Analysis Independence Enforcement (Enhanced Anti-Bias)**

**Mandatory Fresh Analysis Protocol**:

- **External research completion BEFORE scenario analysis**: Complete regulatory framework before any scenario evaluation
- **Independent persona evaluation**: Each persona analyzes scenarios without knowledge of previous conclusions or other persona outputs
- **Fresh scenario comparison**: Build comparison matrix independently using only current canonical + external sources
- **Independent conclusion derivation**: Scenario recommendations based ONLY on current analysis cycle

**Contamination Detection and Prevention**:

- **Structure similarity detection**: If analysis structure matches previous reports >70%, flag as POTENTIALLY-CONTAMINATED
- **Conclusion persistence audit**: If same scenario recommended across versions, require fresh independent justification
- **Persona independence verification**: Each persona's analysis must show unique reasoning independent of others
- **Cross-version bias check**: No inheritance of previous conclusions, preferences, or analytical frameworks

**Independence Certification Requirements**:

- **Source audit trail**: Every conclusion must trace directly to canonical file line or EXTERNAL-STANDARD source
- **Fresh reasoning documentation**: All scenario evaluations must demonstrate new analytical reasoning
- **Independence declaration**: Agent must certify no contamination from previous analysis cycles
- **Bias-free verification**: Conclusions derived solely from current evidence without previous influence
