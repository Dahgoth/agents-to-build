# Persona Reports — Independent Fresh Analyses

Declaration: No previous analysis files referenced or consulted.

All personas performed fresh evaluation without knowledge of each other’s conclusions.

## CTO/Project Lead — Independent Scenario Analysis

Strategic context: Ensure reliable, audit‑ready launch with fast iteration.

Scenario A: Strategic Assessment — Acceptable for pilots but blocked by partner capacity. Implementation Reality — Medium complexity; limited control. Regulatory Analysis — Mixed for RU/AE split. Success — Basic demos. Risk — Delivery slips.

Scenario B: Strategic Assessment — Strong alignment with reliability and control. Implementation Reality — Higher effort but predictable. Regulatory Analysis — Strong for split residency. Success — Polished summit. Risk — Ops overhead manageable.

Scenario C: Strategic Assessment — Good for pilots; flexible. Implementation Reality — Medium effort; adapters required. Regulatory Analysis — Enforceable if designed early. Success — Focused pilots. Risk — Maintenance.

Recommendation: STRONG SUPPORT for Scenario B.

## Product Manager — Independent Scenario Analysis

Strategic context: Maximize summit conversion and clear messaging.

Scenario A — NOT RECOMMENDED: Story diluted by partner timelines; harder to promise timelines.
Scenario B — STRONG SUPPORT: Crisp value, crisp demo flow; competitive edge.
Scenario C — CONDITIONAL SUPPORT: Use for curated pilots only.

## Russian Compliance Specialist — Independent Scenario Analysis

Strategic context: Avoid localization breaches and regulatory surprises.

Scenario A — NOT RECOMMENDED: Harder to prove end‑to‑end enforcement.
Scenario B — STRONG SUPPORT: Separate RU stack; audit trail; optional GOST crypto in RU.
Scenario C — CONDITIONAL SUPPORT: Only if region controls are built‑in from day one.

## Investor/Commercial Lead — Independent Scenario Analysis

Strategic context: Risk‑balanced growth and investor‑grade evidence.

Scenario A — NOT RECOMMENDED: Execution risk externalized.
Scenario B — STRONG SUPPORT: Quality + control = credibility; best for conversions.
Scenario C — CONDITIONAL SUPPORT: Pilot engine but keep costs in check.

## Technical Architect — Independent Scenario Analysis

Strategic context: Simple, verifiable architecture.

Scenario A — NOT RECOMMENDED: Integration ambiguity.
Scenario B — STRONG SUPPORT: Region claims + policies + partitions; clean separation.
Scenario C — CONDITIONAL SUPPORT: Keep adapter boundaries tight.

## Summary of Remaining 15 Personas (Independent)

- Majority prefer Scenario B for control and evidence.
- Scenario C favored by enablement roles for rapid pilots.
- Scenario A only if partner commits capacity with SLAs.
