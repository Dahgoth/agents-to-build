## 3. Security Posture

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Guards (`config/auth.php`)**:
  - `web`: session-based, provider `users` (Eloquent `App\Models\User`)
  - `api`: driver `jwt` (custom)
- **JWT configuration (`config/jwt.php`)**:
  - `key` from `env('JWT_KEY', 'secret')`
  - `video` from `env('VIDEO_JWT_TOKEN', 'video')`
- **Custom middleware (from routing)**:
  - `auth.token` and `auth.token:expert` for protected routes
  - `role.validation:<capabilities>` for RBAC-style checks in Expert/Admin areas
  - `admin.checker` for Admin routes
  - `bearer` for Summit webhook
- **Password resets**:
  - Standard Laravel password reset config using `password_reset_tokens` table
- **CSRF**:
  - Present via default middleware for `web` routes
- **Session management**:
  - Standard Laravel session config present (`config/session.php`) — details not analyzed

### Data Protection (Encryption, Secrets Management)

- **Secrets**:
  - `.env`-based configuration (README indicates `.env.example` present)
  - CI secrets via GitLab CI variables (`ANSIBLE_BECOME_PASSWORD`, hostnames)
- **JWT key**:
  - Default fallback is literal `'secret'` in `config/jwt.php` if `JWT_KEY` is not set; this is insecure for production if not overridden
- **Transport security**:
  - TLS/HTTPS termination: Not found in repository
- **At-rest encryption**:
  - Not found in repository
- **Hashing**:
  - Laravel hashing config present (`config/hashing.php`) — specifics not reviewed
- **Cookies**:
  - Cookie and session config present (`config/cookie.php`, `config/session.php`) — specifics not reviewed
- **CORS**:
  - `config/cors.php` present — specifics not reviewed
- **Rate limiting/throttling**:
  - Not found in repository (standard Laravel features may be available, but no explicit custom rate limiter found)

### Access Control and Roles

- Role-based middleware usage across Expert and Admin scopes:
  - Expert routes use `role.validation:<capabilities>` per endpoint (e.g., `create_course`, `update_lesson`, `analytic_sales`)
  - Admin routes protected by `admin.checker`
- Fine-grained permissions inferred by middleware combinations; implementation not shown here

### Dependency Posture

- **PHP dependencies (partial)**:

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| php | ^8.1 | Runtime |
| laravel/framework | ^10.10 | Core framework |
| laravel/sanctum | ^3.3 | SPA auth cookies |
| firebase/php-jwt | ^6.10 | JWT handling |
| guzzlehttp/guzzle | ^7.2 | HTTP client |
| stripe/stripe-php | ^16.2 | Payments |
| ext-gd | * | Image processing |
| ext-curl | * | HTTP/Network |

Dev-only notable: darkaonline/l5-swagger, barryvdh/laravel-debugbar, laravel/pint, laravel/sail, phpunit/phpunit

- **JS dev dependencies**:

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| vite | ^5.0.0 | Asset bundler |
| laravel-vite-plugin | ^1.0.0 | Laravel-Vite integration |
| axios | ^1.6.4 | HTTP client (frontend tooling) |

### User Roles and Permissions

- Authenticated user (`auth.token`): Profile operations, continue studying, course purchase, favorites, certificates, campus lookup, course content and tests
- Expert (`auth.token:expert` + `role.validation`): Author-level CRUD on courses/lessons/modules/products, analytics access, homework checks, curator management, import, integrations
- Admin (`admin.checker`): User/course/review/answer/support moderation and CRUD

### Current Limitations

- Containerization/Kubernetes: Not found in repository
- Infrastructure provisioning (cloud/IaaS) beyond Ansible: Not found in repository
- TLS/HTTPS handling, WAF/CDN details: Not found in repository
- Centralized secrets manager (e.g., Vault, SSM) integration: Not found in repository
- Security scanning (SAST/DAST/Dependency) in CI: Not found in repository

## 5. Observations

### Gaps, Risks, or Inconsistencies

- JWT key default: `config/jwt.php` falls back to `'secret'` if `JWT_KEY` is not set. This is insecure; production must set a strong secret in environment variables.
- Dual presence of Sanctum and custom JWT:
  - `api` guard is `jwt`; Sanctum config exists for SPA stateful cookies. Ensure consistent auth strategy and correct middleware application to avoid mixed-session/confusion.
- Custom critical middleware (`auth.token`, `role.validation`, `admin.checker`, `bearer`) are central to security posture; their implementations were not reviewed here. Security depends heavily on correctness of these.
- HTTPS/TLS:
  - No explicit configuration for SSL termination or secure cookies was found. Likely handled by infrastructure (Nginx/Load balancer), but not documented in repo.
- CI/CD:
  - GitLab CI relies on `ansible` tagged runners and environment variables for hosts and become password. Ensure runner security and variable scoping/protection.
- Lack of containerization:
  - No Docker/K8s manifests found. Deployment appears to be directly to VMs via Ansible playbook. Operational environments and PHP-FPM/webserver setup are not captured here.
- Rate limiting and abuse protection:
  - Not found in repository. Consider adding Laravel rate limiting for auth endpoints and webhooks.
- Auditing/logging:
  - Not explicitly documented. Laravel logging config exists; no explicit audit logs or security event tracking noted.

### Areas Needing Clarification

- Web server and PHP runtime topology (Nginx/Apache, PHP-FPM versions/config) — Not found in repository
- Exact JWT issuance/validation flow (`CreateJwtTokenService`, `JwtDecoderService`, `auth.token` middleware) — implementation details needed for full security review
- Role definitions and mapping to users/entities for `role.validation` — Not found in repository
- Payment webhook verification mechanisms (Stripe signatures, Robokassa, TBank) — Not found in repository
- Data schema for key entities (users/courses/lessons/tests/payments) — Available in migrations but not summarized here
- Secrets management practices beyond `.env` and GitLab CI vars — Not found in repository

Notes:

- Items marked “Not found in repository” indicate absence in the codebase scan, not necessarily absence in production.
